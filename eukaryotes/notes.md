# CRK11
* LECA genome was rich in introns, suggesting substantial complexity

# Duv07
* features of Eukaryotes
* aerobic organelles acquired after oxygen in atmosphere increases
* mitochondrial-triggered eukaryogenesis theory
* eukaryotic signature proteins suggest deep age
* most organelles can develop anaerobically
    > suggests old, complex ancestor
* eukaryotic genome is chimeric
    - informational genes are achaebacterial
    - operational genes are eubacterial
* fusion theory
* endosymbiotic theory
    - archae host for eu mitochondrion
    - eu host for archae nucleus
* unobserved prokaryotic interactions
* genomic chimerism attributed to LGT
* theories place several events before endosymbiosis
* neomuran theory gives recent origin to archae/eukaryotes
* origin of cytomembrane gives cells freedom from foodstuff
* no existing evidence for primitive phagocyte
* peroxisomes may have originated like mitochondria/plastids
* concludes that mithochondria is last step in eukaryogenesis

# Eme+14
* dates LECA at 1.0-1.9 Ga

# Gri+10
* 3 domains theory puts archaea and eukarya as sister
* 2 domains theory puts euarkyotes created from arcahea and eubacteria
* difficult to resolve ancient phylogenies
* 3 domains theory may be an artefact
* 2 domains theory bypasses hypothetical proto-eukaryote
* various studies show support for both theories
* necessity for new tools to reconstruct phylogeny

# Hed+01
* biomarker evidence 2.7 Ga
* fossils 2.1 Ga
* faster rate in eukaryotes
* support 3 domain hypothesis
* predation leads to LGT
* origin of protoeukaryote comes about 2.7 Ga
* origin of mitochondria comes as later event 1.8 Ga
* times are consistent with geological history

# Kat12
* eukaryotic genes related to Euryarchaeota or Alphaproteobacteria
* eukaryotes also impacted by LGT
* "you are what you eat" hypothesis; genes acquired via engulfment
* genes encoding nucleus lack homologs
* mitochondria derived from Alphaproteobacteria; dna + morph evidence
* loss/transfer of mitochondrial genes to nuclear genome

# Koo10a
* LECA may have been as complex as extant eukaryotes
* significant number of genes
* capapble of flagellar and amoeboid movement
* versatile energy conversion systems

# Koo10b
* key features of eukaryotic cells

# KWG11
* supports 2 domain hypothesis

# RL04
* ring of life hypothesis/fusion origin

# Sog91
* fossil evidence is unreliable

# RA10
* alphaproteobacteria have a virus like GTA (gene transfer agent)
* explains how so many alpha genes became included in eukaryotic genome
